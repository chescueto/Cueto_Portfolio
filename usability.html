		<h1>Usability Study</h1>
			<div>
				<h2>Method</h2>
					<p>My portfolio website was studied. The target audience is teenagers. The subjects found information on the index page, went through the photo album on the Graphics page, and clicked a button on the Javascript page.</p>
				<h2>Results</h2>
				 	<p>All subjects were able to complete each task. However, they all struggled with the first question due to the wording.</p>
				<h2>Discussion</h2>
					<p>There were a few critical comments. One subject thought that the margins should be slightly larger. However, it was generally well-received; two subjects liked the color scheme, and they all agreed that the website was "generally good" for the most part.</p>
